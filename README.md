#### Today's lecture covered several topics related to Git, GitHub, the command-line interface (CLI), graphical user interface (GUI), and the Markdown language. so i learned:

1. Git and GitHub: Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently. 

2. The CLI involves using commands in a terminal or command prompt to execute Git operations, such as creating repositories, committing changes, and pushing code to remote repositories,and GUI interact that provides a visual interface to perform Git operations. 

3. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format and structure plain text documents.
